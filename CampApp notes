Things to install first are: 
- Express 
- Mongoose - make sure its the last version 
- ejs 
- Node - make user its the most stable version 
- nodemon

To check if mongoose is installed, do:
=> npm list mongoose

To check globally:
=> npm list -g  mongoose

Install Mongoose command, do:
npm i mongoose 
- for a specific version e.g. 6.2.8, use:
npm i mongoose@6.2.8 

To install Nodemon, use command:
=> npm install --save-dev nodemon

To install the most stable Node verions, do:
=> sudo n stable

To install that Node version e.g. 16.15.1, do:
=> nvm install 16.15.1

To double check the installed version do:
=> npm version

Starting with creating a simple app: 

To install the latest version of NVM and Node, check the link below:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl

1. to create package.json file
    npm init -y 
2. In the terminal, you could type; ls to see what file has been created 
    ls 
3. To install express and mongoose and ejs, do:
    npm i express mongoose ejs 

4. created the app.js file 

5. after putting the code, we start the server with: 
    nodemon app.js 
If successful? 
1. It should print any console log(' ') on the terminal 
2. It should show the same console log phrase on the page once you open http://localhost:3000/ page 

<!-- const express = require('express'); 
const app = express(); 

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hi From YelpCamp')
})

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("Serving on Port 3000")
}) -->

6. To get ejs to work, first we create views directory of folder 
7. Then we create a home.ejs file with  <h1>This is HOME PAGE - Camp App -</h1>
8. Then check if page loads that h1 

Next - we are going to create our campground model 
part 411 - compground model 
The model will consist of name/title, price, description and location (without longtitude, latitude)

9. We make a models directory, then within it, we create a campground model 

In the next part 412 - we are going to seed some data with some initial campground data so that we can see some progress quickly 

PART 412 - Seeding campgrounds 
1. will setup some fake campgrounds, some seed data to work with, so that when we create our index route, edit route etc.. we actually have somethign to work with. 
2. will a file called seeds, which we will loop to make campgrounds. 
3. two files we have added:
